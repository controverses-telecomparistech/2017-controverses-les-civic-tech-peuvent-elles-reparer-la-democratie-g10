Le travail mené en Sciences de l'information et de la Communication (SIC) interroge le rôle de la configuration des dispositifs de médiation dans la constitution des publics. Il s'agit d'observer comment les choix techniques effectués pour organiser la discussion contribuent à la sélection des publics, dans la mesure où ils leur permettent plus ou moins d'exprimer le lien qui les relie à l'objet du débat. Nous parlerons de leur   concernement   pour qualifier ce lien. Pour mener à bien notre enquête, nous avons mis en place une méthodologie originale de comparaison des espaces   en ligne   et   hors ligne  , mobilisée sur trois études de cas : le débat Ivry Paris-XIII sur la rénovation d'un incinérateur de déchets ménagers, celui sur le projet de Parc éolien en mer des Deux Côtes et enfin celui sur le projet CIGEO, le centre d'enfouissement des déchets nucléaires à Bure. L'enjeu de la thèse est de montrer qu'en fonction des situations, la méthodologie du débat public est plus ou moins mise à l'épreuve par l'objet débattu. Les usages du numérique diffèrent également : s'il est parfois porteur d espoirs d'inclusion de nouveaux publics dans le débat, il peut également être utilisé pour contourner l'expression de la critique sociale. Dans ces derniers cas, nous montrerons comment une forme de   gouvernementalité numérique   contribue à mettre à distance les critiques les plus radicales pour que le débat puisse se tenir, malgré tout.","","2017-05-23 06:49:09","2017-05-23 06:49:09","2017-05-19 11:45:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fr-FR","","","","","","","","","/Users/camilleruppli/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/bce4a9hx.default/zotero/storage/U57SIZDU/Le débat CNDP et ses publics à l'épreuve du numéri.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study builds on previous work by investigating how civic leaders in a large US city conceptualize civic tech, in particular, how they approach the intersection of data, design and civics. We encountered a range of overlapping voices, from providers, to connectors, to volunteers of civic services and resources. Through this account, we identified different conceptions and expectation of data, design and civics, as well as several shared issues around pressing problems and strategic aspirations. Reflecting on this set of issues produced guiding questions, in particular about the current and possible roles for design, to advance civic tech.","2016","2017-05-29 19:33:10","2017-05-29 19:33:10","","2970-2981","","","","","","Data, design and civics","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1145/2858036.2858326","","/Users/camilleruppli/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/bce4a9hx.default/zotero/storage/THQ8KIZA/Boehner and Disalvo - 2016 - Data, design and civics An exploratory study of c.html","","","Civic technology; Design; Speculative design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although conventional social networking services (SNSs) have recently been used for public collaboration, the SNSs are not suitable to look for potential collaborators because the conventional SNSs emphasize recency of information and lack a function for sharing information about “who are trying to address what kind of social issues”. We designed a data model for structuring public issues and goals and built a linked open dataset (LOD) based on the above data model. Moreover, we developed a method for calculating similarities of public goals and implemented a Web service for matching public goals for finding potential collaborators. Our method for similarity calculation incorporates surficial features, semantic features, and contextual features. We conducted an experiment to investigate an optimal balance of parameters of the contextual features, which is suitable for facilitating public collaboration. Furthermore, we held a participatory event for trial use by citizens and observed positive feedbacks from the participants. © 2016, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Progressive Insurance tracks real-time customer driving patterns and uses that information to offer rates truly commensurate with individual safety. Google accurately predicts local flu outbreaks based upon thousands of user search queries. Amazon provides remarkably insightful, relevant, and timely product recommendations to its hundreds of millions of customers. Quantcast lets companies target precise audiences and key demographics throughout the Web. NASA runs contests via gamification site TopCoder, awarding prizes to those with the most innovative and cost-effective solutions to its problems. Explorys offers penetrating and previously unknown insights into healthcare behavior.How do these organizations and municipalities do it? Technology is certainly a big part, but in each case the answer lies deeper than that. Individuals at these organizations have realized that they don't have to be Nate Silver to reap massive benefits from today's new and emerging types of data. And each of these organizations has embraced Big Data, allowing them to make astute and otherwise impossible observations, actions, and predictions.It's time to start thinking big.In Too Big to Ignore, recognized technology expert and award-winning author Phil Simon explores an unassailably important trend: Big Data, the massive amounts, new types, and multifaceted sources of information streaming at us faster than ever. Never before have we seen data with the volume, velocity, and variety of today. Big Data is no temporary blip of fad. In fact, it is only going to intensify in the coming years, and its ramifications for the future of business are impossible to overstate.Too Big to Ignore explains why Big Data is a big deal. Simon provides commonsense, jargon-free advice for people and organizations looking to understand and leverage Big Data. Rife with case studies, examples, analysis, and quotes from real-world Big Data practitioners, the book is required reading for chief executives, company owners, industry leaders, and business professionals.","2013-03-18","2017-05-29 19:33:10","2017-05-29 19:33:10","","","256","","","","","Too Big to Ignore","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: zAemCgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=zAemCgAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Management; Business & Economics / Strategic Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
